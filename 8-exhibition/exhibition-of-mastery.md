# 8-1: Exhibition of Mastery

Congratulations on making it all the way through this course material. Sticking with a self-directed course is no simple task, but you've demonstrated the drive and discipline to succeedâ€”well done.

Or you just skipped to the end, but who would do that??

Courses at TTI conclude with an **Exhibition of Mastery**. This is an opportunity for you to create something new that demonstrates _to yourself and others_ what you've learned. These are not graded or "turned in." Creating them and sharing them is entirely up to you. If you want feedback on what you create, you are more than welcome to do so in our [community Discord](https://discord.gg/taggartinstitute).

## Exhibition Rubric

What kind of a thing should you make? I can't fully answer that question, but I have a funny feeling it should involve containers.

In all seriousness, the baseline for demonstrating that you have mastered this material requires a running Docker application with the following characteristics:

- Exposes a network port
- Consists of multiple linked containers
- Has at least one service that is >1 replicas
- Runs a container based on a custom image
- That custom image is built with a Dockerfile
- The application is defined by a Compose file
- One of the containers must run as a user other than root
- One of the containers must have CPU/Memory limits

If you can deploy such an application, you will have demonstrated mastery of this material.

I wish you good luck, and I thank you for going on this learning journey.
