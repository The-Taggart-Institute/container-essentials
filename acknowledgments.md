# Acknowledgments 

This course would not exist without the support and feedback from the incredible Faculty of The Taggart Institute. My utmost thanks to them for their review of this material before publication.

Gratitude also for the wider TTI community, for their ongoing support and commitment to our mission.

I also have to thank my incredible wife, who tolerates the late-night content creation, video recording sessions, and conversations about arcane technology in pursuit of this mission. 

And a special thank you to my baby daughter, who kept me company on the many nights over which this course was written.
