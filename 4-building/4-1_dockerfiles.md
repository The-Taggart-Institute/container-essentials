# 4-1: Dockerfiles

In the last chapter, we used a Dockerfile to build an image for Impacket tools. That was cool, but wouldn't it be _even cooler_ if we could write our own Dockerfiles to make our images?

That's what we're doing now.

## Read the Docs!

I'm going to tell you up front that we will _not_ be covering every single instruction you can use in a Dockerfile. I strongly recommend you review the [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) and keep it handy as you go through this chapterâ€”and anytime you're creating a Dockerfile, really.

## What Is a Dockerfile?

From one point of view, a Dockerfile is a program. It's a set of instructions to Docker that tells it how to build an image. Simple enough, right?

Let's complicate it.

From _another_ point of view, a Dockerfile is a list of changes, which become layers atop the base image. A really cool way to see this is `docker image history`. Check out the history for one of our Python images.

What you're seeing, in reverse chronological order, is every instruction that went into the Dockerfile to make the image. That's why the "first" one is the `CMD` instruction, which determines the default command to execute when the image is run as a container.

## Writing the Dockerfile

But we're getting ahead of ourselves. We're going to make a new image from a Dockerfile, so let's get get up. Start by making a new folder called `mynodeapp`, and moving into it.

```bash
mkdir mynodeapp
cd mynodeapp
```

As the name might suggest, we're going to be making a tiny NodeJS application. But don't worry, you don't need to know _any_ JavaScript to make this happen. That part we'll handle for you. Download [mynodeapp.zip](./mynodeapp.zip) and extract its contents to your `mynodeapp` folder. You should now have a `src` folder that contains all the application code you'll need. No fuss, no muss.

Using any text editor you like, create a new file called, originally, `Dockerfile`. It's actually a "magic name" that Docker expects for certain operations. 

The first line of our Dockerfile is the `FROM` command. This defines the base image on which we'll build. So yeah, it's not _entirely_ from scratch, but base images are reasonable starting points.

The [Node Image Page](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/tags) shows a ton of tags to choose from. I like to use the latest version with an Alpine flavor. As of this writing, that means the `20-alpine` tag. So our instruction is:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
```

Don't worry that we haven't pulled the image yet; Docker knows what it needs to do during build. We'll get there.
